üßæ About This Tool

`get_EXPANSION.py` is a command-line tool that generates a full Moxfield-compatible decklist for a specified Magic: The Gathering expansion set. It uses the Scryfall API to fetch all cards in the set and intelligently selects the best available printing for each card.

üé® Printing Selection Priorities

For each card, the script evaluates all available printings from the selected expansion and chooses the "best" version using the following priorities (in order):

1. Showcase frame art (highest priority)
2. Borderless variants
3. Extended Art printings
4. Standard frame, English, non-foil

This ensures the exported list favors visually impressive printings while remaining practical for proxying or collection tracking.
